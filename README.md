# Project README: Real World Data Wrangling with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on the practical application of data wrangling techniques using Python. Students will engage in a comprehensive process, from data gathering to answering research questions using real-world datasets.

## Code Quality and Submission Phase

### Success Criteria
- **Functional Code**: No errors in code execution. Warnings are acceptable if not due to poor practices.
- **Submission**: A .zip folder containing:
  - Jupyter Notebook with completed code.
  - Source datasets or a .txt file with dataset links.
  - Data gathering code, if applicable.
  - Both raw and final cleaned datasets.
- **Thorough Documentation**: Justify all wrangling decisions throughout the process.
- **Code Readability**: Include comments for clarity.
- **Completion**: Fill in all “FILL IN” blocks in the notebook.

### Requirements
- **Final Section 'Answering the Research Question'**: At least 2 plots generated.

## Gathering, Assessment, and Cleaning

### Success Criteria
- **Clear Problem Statement**: 2-4 sentences describing the project's focus and datasets.
- **Data Gathering**: At least two datasets using different methods such as:
  - Manual download.
  - Programmatic file downloads.
  - API access.
  - HTML data extraction (BeautifulSoup).
  - SQL database extraction.
- **Dataset Requirements**: Each dataset should have at least two variables and over 500 samples.
- **Dataset Description**: Explain dataset choice, gathering method, and variable significance.
- **Quality and Tidiness Assessment**: Identify two quality issues (e.g., completeness, accuracy) and two tidiness issues. Assess both visually and programmatically.
- **Data Cleaning**: Justify and validate the cleaning methods used.
- **Data Combining and Pruning**: Remove unnecessary variables and merge datasets. Final dataset should have at least 4 variables.

## Data Storage and Answering the Research Question

### Success Criteria
- **Data Store Update**: Maintain different versions of data (raw and cleaned). Ensure both are saved appropriately.
- **Research Question**: Use cleaned data to answer the defined research question.
- **Visualizations**: Produce at least two visualizations and explain their relevance to the research question.
- **Future Steps**: Outline next steps or actions for further project development.
